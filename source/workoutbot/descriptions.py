This bot is designed to make it easier to train at home by offering you the minimum amount of exercises per day.

The workouts are divided into 3 main muscle groups: legs, chest, back. However, with this program, you will develop \
your entire body. Do the workouts consecutively, one a day. In the event of a break, resume where you left off.

After completing 2 cycles in a row (every 6 workouts), on the 7th day, take a rest. If you need more time to recover, \
take a day of rest after each cycle (every 3 workouts).

It is also recommended to train cardio 2-3 times a week. The bot offers cardio training options that you can do at home.

In order to get the most out of this program, you will need a pull-up bar and, at least, one kettlebell. If you have \
no pull-up bar at home, and also if there is no park or platform with pull-up bars nearby, re-generate the workout \
to replace it with an alternative exercise. Also, you can always generate a workout again if you find yourself unsure \
of performing an exercise for any reason.

Remember to warm up before exercising. At the end of the workout, it is recommended to do some stretching for the \
tired muscles. Do not stop training abruptly - when finished, walk in place until your heart rate is restored.

As you adapt to the suggested workouts, start increasing your working weight in the exercises. For example, you can \
add a kettlebell in certain exercises, and, over time, even two. Remember that all exercises should be performed \
carefully following the technique, and not chasing a rapid increase in repetitions or weights.
